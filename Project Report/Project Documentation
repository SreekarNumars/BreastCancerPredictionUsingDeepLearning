Cancer Vision: Advanced Breast Cancer Prediction 
with Deep Learning
 Breast cancer is one of the main causes of cancer death 
worldwide. Computer-aided diagnosis systems showed potential for improving 
the diagnostic accuracy. But early detection and prevention can significantly 
reduce the chances of death. It is important to detect breast cancer as early as 
possible. The goal is to classify images into two classifications of malignant and 
benign. As early diagnostics significantly increases the chances of correct 
treatment and survival. In this application we are helping the doctors and 
patients to classify the Type of Tumour for the specific image given with the help 
of Neural Networks.
