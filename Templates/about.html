            <h2> Breast Cancer Prediction Using Deep Learning</h2>
            <p> Breast cancer is prevalent in women and the second leading cause of death. Conventional breast cancer detection methods require several laboratory tests and medical experts.Automated breast cancer detection is thus very important for timely treatment.This study explores the influence of various feature selection technique to increase the performance of machine learning methods for breast cancer detection. Experimental results shows that use of appropriate features tend to show highly accurate prediction. At our website, we are committed to promoting the use of breast cancer prediction in and educating the public about its benefits. Through our articles and resources, we aim to raise awareness about the  breast cancer and of innovative solutions that can help people and for more sustainable future..
